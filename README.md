5. Contact instructors and tell them that they aren't doing their work, you should do your work if given.

Georleshia
1. Our group will practice a team-building exercise. This can help relationships to build and small conflict to be addressed.
2. Team members contribute more and work harder for any project if they feel like ownership in its success or failure to communicate openly and honestly.
3. This is where communication comes in, making sure that we are available to text or slack when needed. 
4. By speaking with them concerning their part of the group and remebering they are not alone and if they need assistance its okay to ask.
5. Speak with another instructor to try and smooth out the process.

Alexia
1. I will prefer to have a conversation that consist of the problem, how it made you feel or what you think and add a solution behind it.
2. I will communicate the issue explain how this is a group project and ask the why behind it and collectively come up with a better solution.
3. Keep communication open and zoom.
4. I will have a respectful quick check-in
5. notify the instructor if need be.

Kat
1. Communicate Efficiently and help each other out, leave no man behind. We're in this together.
2. Confront them and help them to distribute the work load so that all are being held accountable for part of the project.
3. Being considerate and understanding and help when needed. All questions are good questions. We all have our own talents. Just because you lack some that another may have, doesn't mean you don't have talents in another area that you're good at and maybe they aren't as good at those talents themselves. Everyone is different and learns differently and there is nothing wrong with that.
4. Communicate with them about whats going on, find out why, and fix the problem together.
5. Speak with an instructor in a calm way. There should never be a reason for conflict in a project, all that is needed is to make sure you communicate issues, to whomever it needs to be said to. Being straightforward is key a lot of times in life.
