1. Our group will practice a team-building exercise. This can help relationships to build and small conflict to be addressed.
2. Team members contribute more and work harder for any project if they feel like ownership in its success or failure to communicate openly and honestly.
3. This is where communication comes in, making sure that we are available to text or slack when needed. 
4. By speaking with them concerning their part of the group and remebering they are not alone and if they need assistance its okay to ask.
5. Speak with another instructor to try and smooth out the process.
